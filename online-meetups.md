# Online Meetups
Social distancing? Self isolation? With kids who are missing their friends? Here's some free or affordable and, crucially, safe ways that children can interact online. 


## Lichess 
Got a chess player? Got a friend who's a chess player? They can play online for free here. Just start a game and share the link with a friend to join. Games come with a private text chat facility alongside the board. [Play chess here.](https://lichess.org)

## Minecraft
Popular building and exploration game. If both of you are on compatible versions of Minecraft (Java/pocket edition) one of you can set up a Realm and others can join in the virtual realm world to play. Why not set each other challenges, collaborate on a big build or play a minigame? PEG 7+. Please note that Legacy Console versions do not have the ability to cross play. 
<br>
<br>[Click here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft#) to see which versions are available and if you click on **compare platforms and features** an extensive drop down menu will show you which versions are compatible. 

## Outschool
Live online classes for kids, many on fun topics (always plenty for Pok√©mon and Harry Potter fans), as well as academic subjects, all led by experienced online tutors. You could arrange with a friend to be in the same one-time or recurring class, which generally includes relevant discussion. Parents: classes are reasonably priced and there is a referral sceme where you can get credit for future lessons when your referees take their first class. Outschool are also offering free classes for US children affected by school closures - 2nd link above - non US will need to check if you're eligible - these might also be at unsuitable times, due to time differences, but older kids might like an evening class?

## Thinkers Meetup
Live, online classes taught by experts who are enthusiastic and creative. Classes for young bright thinkers worldwide. Sign up for the same class as your friends! [Join here.](https://www.thinkersmeetup.com)

## Zoom
Designed for video conferencing, this online platform is free for 40 minute sessions and has video, text chat, screen sharing and interactive whiteboard. Sign up, then generate a link and share it with only those you want to meet with online (they must also have signed up). You can screenshare videos and discuss favourite things. Maybe kids can run their own book group or film discussion class? Or if you know a tutor who is at home, they could teach yours and friends, e.g. Spanish. There is a slight delay, which does unfortunately make any kind of music performance over Zoom a challenge, however it's good for most things. [Link here.](https://zoom.us)
