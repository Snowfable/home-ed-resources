# About
Home educators have always shared their resources. Due to the current situation with coronavirus (covid-19), home educators are now sharing their resources for all children at home.

Starting with our local home ed group's list of online education resources, (which went viral on Facebook!), we have expanded on it, and have included information for those whose children are at home unexpectedly. Information here can help them take part in online meet ups safely, virtual tours, excellent apps and other stuff, with more to follow!

Parents - there's already more here than anyone can get through in a lifetime, so - don't panic - relax and let them choose!

This information can be shared for non commercial use. Please do so and help out families who are social distancing, self isolating and self quarantining.
