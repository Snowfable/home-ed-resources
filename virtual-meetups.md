Social distancing? Self isolation? With kids who are missing their friends? Here's some free or affordable and, crucially, safe ways that children can interact online.
Feel free to share!

## Lichess 

Got a chess player? Got a friend who's a chess player? They can play online for free here. Just start a game and share the link with a friend to join. Games come with a private text chat facility alongside the board. [Play chess here.](https://lichess.org)

## Minecraft

Java version

Pocket Edition
 https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/

Popular building and exploration game. If both of you are on the Java version for PC or Mac, or both of you are on Pocket Edition, one of you can set up a Realm and others on the same edition you send an invite to can join you in your virtual world. Why not set each other challenges, collaborate on a big build or play a minigame? PEG 7+

## Outschool

Live online classes for kids, many on fun topics (always plenty for Pok√©mon and Harry Potter fans), as well as academic subjects, all led by experienced online tutors. You could arrange with a friend to be in the same one-time or recurring class, which generally includes relevant discussion. Parents: classes are reasonably priced and there is a referral sceme where you can get credit for future lessons when your referees take their first class. Outschool are also offering free classes for US children affected by school closures - 2nd link above - non US will need to check if you're eligible - these might also be at unsuitable times, due to time differences, but older kids might like an evening class?

## Zoom

Designed for video conferencing, this online platform is free for 45 minute sessions and has video, text chat, screen sharing and interactive whiteboard. Sign up, then generate a link and share it with only those you want to meet with online (they must also have signed up). You can screenshare videos and discuss favourite things. Maybe kids can run their own book group or film discussion class? [Link here.](https://zoom.us)
